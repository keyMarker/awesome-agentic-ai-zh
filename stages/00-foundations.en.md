# Stage 0 — Foundations

⏱ **Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks (~5-15 hours, can skip if you have these)

## When to skip this stage

If you can:
- Write a Python function that calls a public API and parses JSON response
- Use git to clone, commit, push, and resolve a basic merge
- Use the command line on your OS (cd, ls, mkdir, run a script)
- Read a YAML / JSON file without confusion

→ **Skip directly to [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.md)**.

If you can't, work through this stage. Don't skip — every later stage assumes these.

## 📌 Learning Goals

- Write Python: functions, classes, async/await basics
- Use git: clone, branch, commit, push, basic conflict resolution
- Use REST APIs: send GET/POST, parse JSON, handle auth headers
- Read & write YAML and JSON

## 🛠 Hello-X

- **Hello Python** — write a Python script that calls https://api.github.com/users/torvalds and prints follower count
- **Hello git** — clone any public repo, make a commit, push to your fork
- **Hello CLI** — make a small directory tree with the command line (macOS / Linux: `mkdir project && cd project && mkdir src tests docs`; Windows PowerShell: `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path project,project\src,project\tests,project\docs`), run a Python script, redirect output to a file
- **Hello YAML** — read a `.yaml` config file in Python, modify a value, write it back
- **Hello API auth** — at [github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens) generate a personal access token (minimal scope: `read:user`), call the auth-required `https://api.github.com/user` endpoint, observe 401 (no token) vs 200 (with token). Note: real production agents always use API auth — do this exercise

## Why this stage exists

Most "AI agent" tutorials assume you already have these. If you don't, you'll get blocked at random places (tools requires async; configs are YAML; SDK setup needs git). One week investing here saves 10+ weeks of frustration later.
