# Stage 2 — Prompt Engineering

> [繁體中文](./02-prompt-engineering.md) | [简体中文](./02-prompt-engineering.zh-Hans.md) | **English**


⏱ **Time estimate**: 1-2 weeks (~5-12 hours)

> 👋 **Coming from [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.en.md)?** Good — you can call an API. The next 5-12 hours: write reusable structured prompts, use few-shot and chain-of-thought for hard reasoning tasks, and quantify prompt improvement with evals. **Jumped straight here?** Make sure you can call an LLM API and estimate cost in tokens — if not, head back to [Stage 1](01-llm-basics.en.md).

> 💡 Term-unfamiliar? (prompt / few-shot / CoT / system prompt / …) → see [`resources/glossary.en.md`](../resources/glossary.en.md).

## 📌 Learning Goals

After this stage you will be able to:
- Write structured prompts (role + task + format + examples)
- Apply few-shot prompting and know when it helps
- Use chain-of-thought (CoT) for reasoning tasks
- Iteratively refine a prompt and measure improvement
- Recognize when prompting hits its limit (and you need tools / agents)

## 🚪 Entry Conditions

You should already:
- Be able to call an LLM API (Stage 1)
- Be able to parse / iterate over API responses

## 🛠 Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise: System Prompt
Same user message, three different system prompts. Watch the personality / output format change.

### Exercise: Few-Shot
Pick a classification task. Run it 0-shot, then 3-shot. Measure accuracy difference.

### Exercise: CoT
Pick a math word problem. Compare:
- Plain prompt
- Plain prompt + "Let's think step by step"
- Plain prompt + worked example showing CoT

### Exercise: Iterative Refinement
Take a vague prompt, refine it 5 times. Track the iterations. Notice what changes improve quality.

## 🔭 Beyond prompts: context engineering

When you find that **a single prompt can no longer cover the problem** — and you need to dynamically assemble system prompt + retrieved chunks + memory + tool definitions + multi-turn history — you've graduated from prompt engineering to **context engineering**. It's the next layer up.

**Don't try to learn it now**, just know the direction:

- You'll first hit it in [Stage 6 (Memory · RAG)](06-memory-rag.en.md) (what data goes into the prompt)
- You'll fully face it in [Stage 7 (Multi-Agent · Production)](07-multi-agent-production.en.md) (context window budget, memory layering, observability)

Further reading (optional, for when you want to dig deeper):

- [`Windy3f3f3f3f/how-claude-code-works`](https://github.com/Windy3f3f3f3f/how-claude-code-works) (★ 2k+) — Claude Code internals, includes a context-engineering chapter

## ✅ Self-Check Before Stage 3

Can you:
- [ ] Write a prompt with system message + user message + 3 example messages (few-shot)
- [ ] Demonstrate CoT improving accuracy on a reasoning task
- [ ] Iteratively refine a prompt 5 times tracking each version
- [ ] Identify when prompting is the wrong tool (and tool use is needed)

If yes → proceed to [Stage 3 — Tool Use & Agent Intro](03-tool-use-and-hello-agent.en.md). This is the most important stage — don't rush past prompts but also don't get stuck here.
